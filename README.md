Did you know that legislators have little visibility into their own data, including bill text or discussion meeting invitations?  Those hand-scrawled addendums we heard about recently are not an anomaly.

What if legislators could more visibility into their own data? What if they could act and collaborate based on what they hear from each other? What if they could make decisions backed by this data? 

Let’s help them take their first steps. Our stakeholder, the Resilient Democracy Coalition, wants to put non-partisan tools for data visibility into the hands of legislators and their staff, and inspire them to harness the power of data in their everyday work.

The legislative and executive branches communicate with each other through the Federal Register, but there’s no way for a representative’s staff to quickly be notified of events of interest to that representative. Just because a representative cares about an issue doesn’t mean they’re able to hear about relevant actions or events concerning that issue.

The Resilient Democracy team will create a push notification system for staffers to use, so they can learn when a meeting or memo of interest is published in the Federal Register.
